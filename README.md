# Machine Learning models for Formula 1

This is a deep learning model that takes Formula 1 Image Data and classifes images into Ferrari or Merecdes classical F1 cars. 

## Steps to Run 

* Download Jupyter Notebooks (Anaconda): https://www.anaconda.com/
* Import Dependencies using `pip install`
* Download classical Ferrari and Mercedes images from Google images 
* Train the Model 
* The model should be running (training for accuracy and precision) 


## How to test the model correctly
* Use an image of a Ferrari or Mercedes car that the model has never seen before 
* Find the correspending value of yhat (output value) 
* Finished! 
* Train on more image data as needed
